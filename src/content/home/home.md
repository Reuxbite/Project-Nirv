Project NIRV is a research initiative built around **non-linear learning** and **directional insight**. I examine systems, markets, and ideas without assuming linear behavior.

I collect information from verified sources, remove noise, and publish concise, data-backed studies. My aim is clarity: understand how systems operate, why they evolve, and where they are likely to move.
