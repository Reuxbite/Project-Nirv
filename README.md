# Project Nirv

![Project Nirv Logo](public/nirv.png)

Project Nirv functions as a research initiative built around the idea of **non-linear learning** and **directional insight**.  
The name represents its framework: **Non-Linear Intelligence Research Vector** — a structured method for examining systems, markets, and ideas without assuming linear behavior.

The project collects information from verified sources, removes noise, and publishes concise, data-backed studies.  
The aim is clarity: understand how systems operate, why they evolve, and where they are likely to move.

## Purpose

- Establish a consistent vector for ongoing research  
- Produce structured breakdowns of markets and systems  
- Highlight patterns, interactions, and second-order effects  
- Build a public archive of distilled insight

## Approach

- Non-linear thinking models  
- Source-based verification over speculation  
- Synthesis over commentary  
- Directional analysis over static description
